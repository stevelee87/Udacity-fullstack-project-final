# Udacity-fullstack-project-final
Deploy the item catalog project ( https://github.com/stevelee87/Udacity-fullstack-project2 ) hosted in an AWS LightSail running Ubuntu and using PostgreSQL

## 1 Introduction

Please first refer to the Project 2 to understand how this web app works. This project is meant to focus only in to deploy this project 2 web app into the web using an AWS LightSail instance of Ubuntu 18.4 with the listed below requirements.

From Udacity's website:

### Project Overview
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it.

### Why this Project?
A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, youâ€™ll be responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.

### What will I Learn?
You will learn how to access, secure, and perform the initial configuration of a bare-bones Linux server. You will then learn how to install and configure a web and database server and actually host a web application.
